Extend your Deque class from Lab 10, making corrections if necessary. You may use the updated DequeTest.java to test your code. 

1. Correct any errors reported in your feedback from Lab 10. This applies to both your Deque and Node classes. You may, 
	optionally, make your Node an inner class of Deque. (10pts)

2. public String toString(): Add this method, which takes no parameters and converts the Deque to a String, with elements listed 
	in order from head to tail. The format of the string must be as follows: (15 pts)
	
	a. An opening square bracket ('[').
	b. For each node from the head up to, but not including, the tail, the value of the node plus a comma and a single space (", ").
	c. The value of the tail node, if any, with no additional punctuation or spacing.
	d. A closing square bracket (']').

3. public String toStringReverse(): Add this method, which takes no parameters, and converts the Deque to a String, with elements 
	listed in order from tail to head. The format of the string must be as follows: (15 pts)
	
	a. An opening square bracket ('[').
	b. For each node from the head up to, but not including, the tail, the value of the node plus a comma and a single space (", ").
	c. The value of the tail node, if any, with no additional punctuation or spacing.
	d. A closing square bracket (']').

4. Document and format your code according to course Coding Standards. (10 pts)

Submit your updated Deque.java and Node.java (note that if you fail to include Node.java, or, optionally, implement your Node as an inner class, 
	your code will not compile and is subject to 50% penalty for non-compiling code per the syllabus).
