//		CS 111
//		Coding Conventions
//		Spring 2023
		
//		The following information was obtained from the Sun, Java coding conventions: Why
//		have coding conventions?
//
//		 80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to
//		maintenance.
//
//		 Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the
//		original author.
//	
//		 Code conventions improve the readability of the software,
//		allowing engineers to understand new code more quickly and
//		thoroughly.
		
		
		
		
		
//		All weekly lab assignments (involving code) and programming assignments must
//		adhere to the following conventions.
//
//		1) Each separate java file must begin with a block comment (/* text */) containing the following:
//			Name: your name
//			Project #, or Lab Assignment # ie: Lab Assignment #3
//			Lab Instructor: Your TA’s Name
//			Date:
//			Purpose: This should contain a description of the files contents, listing
//			the names of all classes the files contains, and a brief description
//			of each. If the file contains the main program which represents
//			your application, the purpose, and operations performed by the
//			main program are briefly described.
		
//		2) Following the file description comments the statements will occur in order of package, import, and class statements.
		
//		3) All class names must begin with a capital letter.
		
//		4) Multi-word method names or variable names should be in camel case ie: studentGrade or calculateGrade
		
//		5) Single letter identifiers are NOT acceptable except as “counters” in loops.
		
//		6) The names of any declared constants (final variables) must be in all capital letters. ie: final float INTEREST_RATE = .06f;
		
//		7) “Magic Numbers” are not permitted for any constant numeric values used
//			inside your code that represent important values in calculations. See the example above
		
//		8) At the top of each user defined class should be a block comment thoroughly
//			describing the purpose and content each the class (NOTE: this is not needed
//			for a class that just contains a main method, and it is possible for a single
//			java file to contain multiple classes)
//			Class Name: Name of the class
//			Purpose: Brief description of the class and what it does
//			Exceptions: List and describe each type of exceptions the class can produce
		
//		9) At the top of every method should be a block comment containing:
//			Method Name: name of the method
//			Purpose: Brief description of the methods purpose, or calculation performed by the method
//			Parameters: List each parameter received by this method, with a description of their purpose
//			Preconditions: statement of any conditions that must be true at the beginning of the execution of this method
//			Postconditions: Statement of the expected results of this method, including return values
//			Exceptions: Statement of any exceptions produced by this method
		
//		10)Indentation: The body of every block (code contained between {} ) must be indented with respect to the surrounding code.
		
//		11) Comments should be scattered throughout the body of your methods and
//			main program as needed to explain the rationale for doing things a certain
//			way (i.e. focus on why the code is written as it is, not what the code is doing).
		
//		IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO COMMENT EVERY LINE OF CODE.
