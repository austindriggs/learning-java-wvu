 * 
 * Turn in the following source files (directly, not in a ZIP file or other archive):
 * 	GraphicObject.java
 * 	Circle.java
 * 	Rectangle.java
 * 	Square.java
 * 	Ellipse.java
 * 	ObjectOperations.java
 * 	Tester Class
 * 
 * Assignment is due at 11:59pm on March 6.
 * 
 * -
 * 
 * Key Concepts:  Reading data files, Inheritance, Polymorphism, interfaces and Abstract Classes (all of these topics have been covered in class)
 * 
 * In this assignment you will create a family of related “graphic objects”.  You will create an abstract GraphicObject class which contains 
 * attributes common to all graphic object shapes.  You will implement a series of sub classes, and then in the tester program will  create an 
 * array of graphic objects whose elements contain references to the subtypes of the abstract GraphicObject class.
 * 
 * This program uses a publicly available drawing library created by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne to simplify the process of drawing graphic 
 * objects to the computer screen.  Documentation for the class can be found at :  https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdDraw.html
 * 
 * The class can be down loaded at:  https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/StdDraw.java 
 * 
 * To learn how to use the package StdDraw, see the video at the top of our lecture ecampus page.
