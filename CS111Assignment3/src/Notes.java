/*
 * Background: In this assignment you will create an abstract data type to represent user processes.  A process is a program in execution under control 
 * of the operating system.  Every time a “user” enters a command or runs a program a user process is created by the operating system, to represent 
 * the program in execution.  These processes are maintained by the OS, and exist until either the program terminates gracefully and exits the system, 
 * or terminates with an error.  A process has a “state” which represents the current activity in which it is engaged, and processes migrate through 
 * many states during their lifetime, a process may be “blocked” waiting the completion of an event for example the completion of a I/O 
 * operation (A process cannot execute if it is waiting for the completion of an event), a process might be “ready” waiting for the chance to 
 * execute, and a process might be “running” or actively executing using the CPU (central processing unit).  A multiprogramming (multitasking) 
 * operating system is one that has multiple processes in memory simultaneously which share the CPU through “interleaved” execution.  This means 
 * that the processes take turns executing according to some scheduling algorithm.  Processes that are ready to execute are maintained on a special 
 * queue called the “ready queue”.
 * 
 * In this program we will simulate a multiprogramming  operating system dispatching processes.  To do this we will use a Round Robin scheduling 
 * algorithm.  Processes are executed in the order in which they are inserted into the ready queue.  As each process begins execution it is given 
 * a “time slice” which is a brief amount of CPU time it is allowed to use before it is interrupted and placed back into the ready queue.  Processes 
 * are processed in a circular fashion based on their order in the ready queue.  This algorithm assumes: 
 * 
 * • That every process will be given the same length of time slice
 * • That we know the burst time of each process (which is the maximum amount of CPU time the process will use, before terminating)
 * • Time slices will always be 100 milliseconds (a millisecond is 1/1000 of a second)
 * • Burst times for processes will be specified in seconds
 * • For each process we will calculate:
 * 		o Its total waiting time (total time spent waiting in the ready queue not executing)
 * 		o Its turn around time (The difference in the time between when the process entered the system, and the time when it finishes execution)
 * 
 * 1.	Create a Process class to track the execution of each process. You will implement the following methods:
 * a.	The constructor takes two parameters: The process ID, and the burst time in seconds. It must set the wait time and time of last execution both to 0.
 * b.	getID(): Returns the process ID.
 * c.	getBurst(): Returns the burst time of the process in milliseconds.
 * d.	getWaitTime(): Returns the total waiting time in milliseconds.
 * e.	getLastExecutionTime(): Returns the time since the beginning of simulation that the process was last execute in milliseconds.
 * f.	execute(): Simulates the process consuming CPU time.
 * 		i.	Calculate the time the process has been waiting for execution. Subtract the last execution time (in milliseconds) from the current 
 * 				time (in milliseconds), and add the difference to the process’s total wait time.
 * 		ii.	Update the last execution time to the end of the current time slice (the current time plus the length of one time slice, in milliseconds).
 * 		iii.	Reduce the process’s burst time by one time slice (100 milliseconds).
 * g.	isComplete(): Returns true if the process’s burst time is <= 0; otherwise returns false.
 * 
 * 2.	Create a PriorityQueue class. This differs from an ordinary queue in that elements are added after elements of higher priority, but before 
 * 			elements of lower priority, rather than just at the end of the queue.
 * a.	The constructor takes no parameters and creates an empty queue.
 * b.	priorityEnqueue():  This method adds a new Process to the queue, based on the burst time of the process. (hence: it must traverse the queue, 
 * 			and locate where the new process should be inserted.).  Processes with the shortest burst time should be at the front of the queue.  If 
 * 			an existing process in the queue has the same burst time as the new one, the new process goes after the existing process.
 * c.	enqueue(): Takes a Process and adds it to the end of the queue (this method does not take priority into account).
 * d.	dequeue(): Returns the first Process in the queue after removing if from the queue.
 * e.	isEmpty(): Returns true if the queue is empty.
 * 
 * SEE DIAGRAM
 * 
 * 3.	A Simulator class of static methods to simulate the execution of the set of processes:
 * a.	enqueueProcesses(): Opens filename for reading parses its contents, creating a PriorityQueue of Process objects. If the priority flag is 
 * 			true, Processes are placed in the queue in priority order (using priorityEnqueue()); otherwise, Processes are place in the queue in FIFO 
 * 			order (using enqueue()). Each line of the provided data file consists of two values: A process ID (a String), and the burst time (in 
 * 			seconds as an integer). Create one Process object per line in the file, enqueue it using the appropriate method, and return the queue 
 * 			when the data file has been completely read.
 * b.	simulate(): Simulates the execution of processes in the system until all processes have completed.
 * 		i.	There is no easy way to measure elapsed time, so we will simulate a clock using a loop that executes until there are no more processes in 
 * 				the queue.  Each time a process executes it will run for its full time slice, or until it finishes if it needs less than a full time 
 * 				slice.  You will need a variable that stores the current wall clock time:  After loading processes, the simulation begins at time 0.  
 * 				This “clock” will advance as processes execute, by adding the time a process executes to the time in the clock (i.e. the “clock” will 
 * 				increase by one time slice (in milliseconds) every pass through the loop).
 * 		ii.	The each iteration of the simulation should proceed as:
 * 			1.	Dequeue the first process and simulate its execution by calling its execute() method. Print out a statement that that the process was 
 * 					executed, showing the process ID and burst time remaining.  
 * 			2.	If the process is not complete, add it back to the end of the queue (using enqueue(), not priorityEnqueue()).
 * 			3.	If the process is complete, print out an additional line stating the process finished, its id, its total waiting time, 
 * 					and its turnaround time.
 * 				a.	The turnaround time of a process is the total amount of time it spends in the system before completing it’s work.  It is the 
 * 						total of all the time a process spends waiting and executing.  All processes enter the system at time zero.  This 
 * 						should be in minutes and seconds.
 * 				b.	The wait time of a process is the total amount of time it spends waiting in the ready queue, it is the difference between the 
 * 						current time, and the time that is last finished executing.  This should be in minutes and seconds
 * 		iii.	For the entire set of processes you will ALSO calculate the average waiting time and the average turnaround time.  In theory, executing 
 * 					the processes in order based on their burst time should produce a shorter average wait time.
 * 		iv.	At the end of the simulation, you should print out the total elapsed time between when the simulation started (time zero) 
 * 				and all processes finished.
 * c.	main(): This method is provided for you. Simulates the execution of processes, comparing priority queuing and FIFO queuing.
 * 		i.	Prompt the user for the name of a data file.
 * 		ii.	Creates a queue in FIFO order using enqueueProcesses() with the file name read in step i, and simulate execution of that queue using simulate().
 * 		iii.	Creates a queue in priority order using enqueueProcesses() with the same file name read in step i, and simulate execution 
 * 					of that queue using simulate().
 * 
 * What to submit?
 * 1.	Process.java
 * 2.	PriorityQueue.java 
 * 3.	Simulator.java
 * 4.	(10 points)  assess your results, is there a difference in the total average waiting time?  Why or Why not.  This will be in the form of 
 * 			a document submitted with your program
 * 
 * Also remember:  Documentation and proper commenting is worth (30 points): Follow the Java Coding Style and Documentation.
