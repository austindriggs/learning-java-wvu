Using the attached Deque.java and Node.java , reimplement the Deque class as a doubly-linked list backed by Node objects. The class names must not be changed from the assignment; changing either class name will result in a grade of 0 for the assignment. You may use DequeTest.java and NodeTest.java  to test your implementation.

Node class. This needs to working before you can effectively move on to the Deque. It should take no more than 10 minutes (excluding 
	documenation). There is nothing complex or tricky here, just getters and setters that directly read or write the fields.
		
		Fields. You'll need a field for the data object and fields to reference the next and previous nodes. Fields must be private. (1pt)
		Constructor. Takes three parameters: The data object, a (possibly null) reference to the next object in the list, and a (possibly null) 
			reference to the previous object in the list. Sets fields accordingly. (1pt)
		getData(): Returns a reference to the data object stored in this node. (1pt)
		setData(): Updates the node to reference a new data object (1pt)
		getNext(): Returns a reference to the next node in the list. (1pt)
		setNext(): Updates the node to change what the next node refers to. (1pt)
		getPrev(): Returns a reference to the previous node in the list. (1pt)
		setPrev(): Updates the node to change what the previous node refers to. (1pt)

Deque class. The interface is identical to Lab 8. It should be possible to drop this new implementation into any project using the 
	previous implementation without any change to other code.
	
		Fields. You'll need fields referring to the head and tail of the list. You may also want a size field. Fields must be private. (3pts)
		Constructor. Takes no parameters, initializes the list to be empty. (3pts)
		addFirst(): Takes an object and inserts it before the head of the list. (10pts)
		removeFirst(): Removes the first object from the head of the list and returns it as a reference. Throws a NoSuchElementException 
			if the list is empty. (10pts)
		getFirst(): Returns a reference to the object at the head of the list. Throws a NoSuchElementException if the list is empty. (10pts)
		addLast(): Takes an object and adds it after the tail of the list. (10pts)
		removeLast(): Removes the last object from the tail of the list and returns it as a reference. Throws a NoSuchElementException if 
			the list is empty. (10pts)
		getLast(): Returns a reference to the last object at the tail of the list. Throws a NoSuchElementException if the list is empty. (10pts)
		size(): Returns the current number of objects in the list. (6pts)
